Sqimitive.js - a JavaScript primitive
=====================================

Sqimitive is a lightweight framework of several classes for modular, event-based
programming on top of native ES5+ JavaScript, in browser or server environment.

  * Ubiquitous events - reactive programming and inheritance without "__super__"
  * Unlimited nesting of objects - powerful collections out of the box
  * Tight integration with the DOM - working with data objects, not nodes

The motto is: do not over-engineer.

  * No transpilers
  * No trove of classes
  * No complicated solutions
  * Simplicity is key

Size: 27K minified, 9K gzipped.

Sqimitive is the integral part of HeroWO.js - a JavaScript re-implementation of
Heroes of Might and Magic III.
