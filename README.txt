Sqimitive.js - a JavaScript primitive
=====================================

Sqimitive is a lightweight framework of several classes for modular, event-based
programming on top of native ES5 JavaScript.

  * Ubiquitous events - reactive programming and inheritance without "super"
  * Unlimited nesting of objects - powerful collections out of the box
  * Tight integration with the DOM - working with data objects, not nodes

The motto is: do not over-engineer.

  * no transpilers
  * no trove of classes
  * no complicated solutions
  * simplicity is key

  * NoDash (http://squizzle.me/js/nodash)
