Powered by `@https://github.com/ProgerXP/Orphus`@.\n\n`## Basic code conventions\n\n`* `*Protected fields begin with underscore (`'_)`* - such fields (data properties and methods) are meant to be read or written only by the class they are defined in, or by one of its subclasses. It's bad practice to try to access them from an ancestor (not the descendant they're defined in) or, mind you, from an unrelated class - this is only justified, if ever, by really severe optimizations (such as tons of `@Base._opt`@ calls bypassing `#get()).\n\n`* `*Naming style: underscores separating camelCase`* - when an identifier (`[oneId`]) needs to be combined with another (`[twoId`]) it becomes simply `[oneId_twoId`] instead of `[oneIdTwoId`], `[one_id_two_id`] or something else dictated by \"pretty printing\" identifiers. For example, `#Base fires events of form \"`#change_OPT\" so the event name used when `'attrName option (`@Base._opt`@) was changed is `'change_attrName.\n\n`* `*Semicolon-free zone`* - JavaScript is one of those languages where operation separators are optional, much like in Lua. You just need to remember to put `[;`] before any operation beginning with `[(`] (which most of the time has to do with IIFE):\n  `[\n    foo = 123\n    ;(function () { ... })()\n      // without ; above is equivalent to 123(function () { {... })()\n  `]\n\n`* `*`'null is `'undefined`* - unless mentioned, these two values are used interchangeably: when testing, use `[value == null`] instead of `[===`]; when supplying, give any of the two. One case when `'undefined is different are event handler results (see `#::fire()).\n\n`##deps Customizing dependencies\n\nSqimitive can be included using several methods as implemented by `[umh.js`]. Each method has its own way of overriding dependencies (which default to NoDash `@no@`@ and jQuery `@jq:`@). Alternatively, you can change the `'deps variable in the source code but you'll have to redo it on upgrade.\n\n`### CommonJS/Node.js\nIn npm 8.3+, put this into your project's `[package.json`] before doing `[npm install sqimitive`] (`@https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/4909`@):\n`[\n  \"overrides\": {\n    \"sqimitive\": {\n      \"nodash\": \"npm:underscore\",\n      \"jquery\": \"npm:zepto\"\n    }\n  }\n`]\n\n`### AMD/Require.js\nUse `'map and/or `'path options (`@https://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#config`@):\n`[\n  requirejs.config({\n    map: {\n      'sqimitive/main': {\n        'nodash/main': 'lodash'\n      },\n      'sqimitive/jquery': {\n        jquery: 'zepto'\n      }\n    },\n    paths: {\n      nodash: 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/underscore@latest/underscore-umd-min.js'\n    }\n  })\n`]\n\n`### Plain `[<script>`]\nDependencies land in global `'window so simply fetch the needed script before including Sqimitive:\n`[\n  <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/underscore@latest/underscore-umd-min.js\"></script>\n  <script src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ProgerXP/Sqimitive/master/sqimitive.min.js\"></script>\n`]\n\n\n","start":{"line":80,"column":-1,"offset":2134},"end":{"line":171,"column":-1,"offset":7273},"forced":null,"modifiers":[],"file":"HELP.chem"},"796":{"type":"page","id":796,"name":"vsbb","comment":"`! +pg=vsbb +pgo=10\n\n`# Comparing with Backbone\n\nSqimitive has been inspired by Backbone.js (`@bb:`@) and was written as a solution to most annoying problems after working with Backbone for months in a production project. It avoids certain less used (read: project-specific) features while conceptually bringing the rest under one roof. In particular, Sqimitive:\n\n`* Removes somewhat artificial separation for Model, Collection and View classes providing a single unified \"primitive\" (the \"sqimitive\"). This way Views can use options (`#opt - attributes with on-change notifications, `#change_OPT), Underscore.js helpers (`#util), object nesting (`#chld - just like Collections), jQuery/Zepto bindings (`[this.el`], `@jQuery.elEvents`@) and every other feature, shared by all, not imposed on any.\n\n`* Greatly expands on the idea of events (`#evt), making inheritance as sensible as possible given JavaScript's idea of OOP and adding automatic event management for connected objects (e.g. elements of a collection - `#_childEvents).\n\n`* Removes server-side communication layer (`@bb:Model-sync`@) while keeping routines to smart-update object states (`#assignChildren(), `#assignResp()). Instead of overriding parts of the library (as it's often done with Backbone) you implement them yourself just once given your unique project requirements.\n\nWhile different, Sqimitive will appear very familiar to Backbone users and being paradigm-free, it will even let you work the way you used with Backbone or another framework - in aspects you wish. You can create your own Model, Collection and View classes to follow MVC, use traditional `'__super__-style inheritance, write your specific `'sync() routines and so on.\n\nThis section highlights most notable gaps present in Backbone and other frameworks. Strictly subjective!\n\n`## OOP that makes sense\n\nIn Backbone and other JavaScript frameworks inheritance (overriding of parent properties and methods) is painful.\n\n` `*With properties`*, if it's a complex object that you would rather extend (append to) rather than replace entirely - as it is the case with `@bb:Model-attributes`@, `@bb:Model-defaults`@, `@bb:View-events`@ (DOM bindings) and others - you have to add them in the constructor because if you define such a property in the child class you will `*entirely overwrite the inherited value`*. Moreover, if at some point the base class that did not have that property decided to declare it - all its subclasses overwrite it without notice... Unless you remember to update them, which is an unnecessary cognitive burden.\n\n` `*With methods`*, you have to hardcode reference to the base class - that's not to mention the entire construct which is already ugly: `[My.Class.__super__.baseMethod.apply(this, arguments)`]. So if you later rename the base class or move this subclass under another parent, or rename the method, or just make a typo - the entire inheritance chain for this method is broken. You may or may not get an error, too.\n\nThis is the price for trying to push classic OOP into JavaScript prototype model.\n\nSqimitive solves both problems by using `#_mergeProps for listing which properties should be merged together on extension. For methods, there is a fantastic event-driven inheritance (`#evt) that makes JavaScript OO coding a breeze. Any method can be turned into an event without altering the base class, it can be temporary (`#once()) and works for \"traditional\" events too, like `#change notifications.\n\nAt the same time, the `'__super__ way of doing this is still available if you are feeling a bit masochistic.\n\nBelow is just one simple example. Look for more details at the mentioned sections.\n\n`[\n  var MyBaseClass = Sqimitive.jQuery.extend({\n    complexProp: {\n      base: 123,\n    },\n\n    init: function () {\n      alert('I init()!')\n    },\n  })\n\n  // _mergeProps is a static property.\n  MyBaseClass._mergeProps.push('complexProp')\n\n  var MySubclass = MyBaseClass.extend({\n    complexProp: {\n      sub: 'foo',\n    },\n\n    events: {\n      init: function () {\n        alert('Now I init() too!')\n      },\n    },\n  })\n\n  var obj = new MySubclass\n    // 1. alert: I init()!\n    // 2. alert: Now I init() too!\n  alert(obj.complexProp.base)\n    // alert: 123\n  alert(obj.complexProp.sub)\n    // alert: foo\n`]\n\n`## Built-in child nesting\n\nBackbone offers no nested views out of the box. There are plugins such as Babysitter (from Marionette.js, `@https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.babysitter`@) but they don't provide a complete solution.\n\nIn Sqimitive, nested views are native. When used, they are automatically managed: elements and event listeners removed (`#autoOff()) when the corresponding view is removed, DOM events rebound (`@jQuery.elEvents`@) and root element reinserted (`@jQuery.attach()`@) when root element is moved (e.g. on `#render()), it is possible to filter (`#util) nested views using Underscore methods (just like filtering contents of `@bb:Collection`@s in Backbone), receive notifications about newly `#nested/`#unnested/changed views, maintain sort order (`#Ordered, `#_repos) and so on.\n\nNo more need for `'delegateEvents(), `[off(null, null, this)`] or `[return this`] (when overriding `'render() thanks to `#evtpf).\n\nSee more details and examples in the Views overview section (`#vw).\n\n`## Change-driven behaviour\n\nIn Backbone and other frameworks, you have to track changes to your data and view states. Backbone eases this task by providing standard events like `[change:attr`] event for Models. However, this approach must be brought further to let us take full advantage of it.\n\nIn Sqimitive, you get a special object property - `@Base._opt`@ (\"options\") - that is a pool of trackable states, similar to Backbone's `@bb:Model-attributes`@. Items in this pool are read with `#get() and written with `#set(). When a new and different value is written a bunch of events occurs; within their listeners you can cancel or normalize the change (`#normalize_OPT()) or perform an action (`#change_OPT() and `#change()). Parent sqimitives can optionally forward their children events to themselves (`#_childEvents).\n\nThis can be used to create event observation spots too. Suppose that you have an object that's loading some data from the server. Since it's asynchronous you don't know when (or if) it will finish. Usually you would either create a callback property and call it or use a custom event (like jQuery and Backbone do) and trigger it once loading is done. In Sqimitive, you simply introduce some `[_opt.loading`], set it to `'false initially and once done - change to `'true. Observers listen to the `'change_loading event having the full set of event handling routines at their disposal (`#on, `#once, `#fuse, `#off, `#autoOff, `#logEvents, etc.) instead of introducing `'isLoading(), `'abortLoading(), `'onLoading(), etc.\n\nThanks to the new option, this starts working the other way too: an external object can `[set('loading', true)`] to trigger data refresh on the object. Better still - the loading object itself can set this option to trigger its own loading routine - naturally, avoiding code duplication.\n\nMoreover, since options are not accessed directly you can always listen for their access with `'get or add custom behaviour with `'set, disregarding the fact they are originally methods (`#get(), `#set()). Lack of direct access to `#opt'ions improves stability of the code base.\n\nGiven this mechanism you can significantly lower your `'render() and custom event rates while being much more aware of what has triggered the change at the same time, performing incremental (lightweight) updates. And since Models and Views are the same thing in Sqimitive these principles work universally for any kind of object you might have.\n\n`[\n  var MyView = Sqimitive.jQuery.extend({\n    _opt: {\n      loading: false,\n      people: [],   // array of names.\n    },\n\n    // We will keep jqXHR object here to be able to abort the request.\n    _loadingXHR: null,\n\n    events: {\n      init: function () {\n        // Wait 300 msec and then start fetching server data.\n        _.delay(_.bind(this.set, this, 'loading', true), 300)\n      },\n\n      // Loading was either cancelled or started.\n      change_loading: function (value) {\n        // Update class name of our DOM element.\n        this.el.toggleClass('loading', value)\n        // Abort old request, if any.\n        this._loadingXHR && this._loadingXHR.abort()\n\n        if (value) {\n          // Fetch the data, pass to _load().\n          this._loadingXHR = $.getJSON('api/get/some', _.bind(this._load, this))\n        }\n      },\n\n      // _opt.people changed - update names.\n      change_people: '_updatePeople',\n\n      render: function () {\n        // Retrieve all _opt to pass them to the template.\n        var vars = this.get()\n        // Overwrite with new HTML.\n        this.el.html(_.template($('#MyViewTemplate').text(), vars))\n        // Add peoples' names.\n        this._updatePeople()\n      },\n    },\n\n    _updatePeople: function () {\n      var el = this.$('.people').empty()\n\n      _.each(this.get('people'), function (name) {\n        $('<em>').text(name).appendTo(el)\n      })\n    },\n\n    _load: function (resp) {\n      // Do something with resp, then finally:\n      this.set('loading', false)\n    },\n  })\n`]\n\n`## Events do occur on events - no cheating\n\nIf you have used Backbone's `'add, `'remove and `'change events then you probably know that they do not occur... always. For example, if you `'reset() a Collection it won't fire `'add for new Models, `'remove for gone or `'change for existing Models that were updated.\n\nThis smells like an optimization - after all, firing hundreds of events when resetting a huge Collection might be slow. However, such cases are very rare and yet the existence of `'reset() makes it problematic to track the updates because often you will end up with your own routine bound to `'reset as an event that will figure the difference between old Collection contents and new one.\n\nThis also happens with attribute normalization on Models that for some reason doesn't occur when assigning an API response.\n\nSqimitive fires events when things change, period. In case you do have a performance-heavy object you can always implement your own, less \"noisy\" and more optimized update routines. However, 90% of the time you will rely on `#nest, `#unnested, `#change and others to keep you notified.\n\n`## Cloned instance properties\n\nIn JavaScript, when you create a prototype with properties having non-scalar values (like objects or arrays) what you actually create are `*shared instance properties`*. If at run-time you modify such a property (but not reassign it) this operation will affect all objects where that property was defined, unless its value was overwritten with a new object.\n\nBackbone inherits this behaviour which most of the time leads to very confusing results (from the human's perspective). Consider this snippet (`@http://jsfiddle.net/Proger/vwqk67h8/`@):\n\n`[\n  var MyView = Backbone.View.extend({foo: []})\n  var first = new MyView\n  var second = new MyView\n  first.foo.push(123)\n  alert(second.foo[0])\n  // alert: 123\n`]\n\nThe only way around is to assign such properties in the constructor, which you should first override using the crazy `[My.Class.__super__.baseMethod.apply(this, arguments)`] construct. This gives your code -50 points in the ability to save kittens on this planet!\n\nSqimitive eliminates this problem by automatically deep cloning (`#deepClone) all complex values upon new object instantiation. Of course, sometimes this is not desired - for this you can always assign them in the constructor just like before or list them in `#_shareProps to prevent automatic cloning.\n\n`## Backbonization\n\nThe following tricks can be used to make Sqimitive's API appear more like Backbone's. It will not make it 100% identical so don't use it in production as is - it's intended to give you some pointers.\n\n`### General\n\nIn Backbone, `#_cid is named `@bb:Model-cid`@, `@jQuery.el`@ is `@bb:View-$el`@ with the `@bb:View-el`@ counterpart (native DOM node), `#fire() is named `@bb:Events-trigger`@(), `@bb:Events-listenTo`@() and `@bb:Events-stopListening`@() are `#autoOff()  flavours, `@bb:Model-toJSON`@() is basically `#get(), `@bb:Model-attributes`@ is the same as `@Base._opt`@, `@bb:Model-defaults`@ are declaration-time `'_opt.\n\n`[\n  var BackboneBase = Sqimitive.Base.extend('BackboneBase', {\n    cid: null,    // alias to _cid; do not write to.\n\n    events: {\n      '-init': function () {\n        this.cid = this._cid\n      },\n\n      init: function () {\n        this._childClass = this._childClass || this.model   // used below.\n      },\n    },\n\n    trigger: function (event, arg_1) {\n      return this.fire(event, _.rest(arguments))\n    },\n\n    listenTo: function (sqim, event, func) {\n      this.autoOff(sqim, _.object([[event, func]]))\n      return this\n    },\n\n    stopListening: function (sqim, event, func) {\n      if (!arguments.length) {\n        return this.autoOff()\n      } else if (func || (sqim && event)) {\n        throw new Error('Unsupported stopListening() call.')\n      } else {\n        return this.off(event || sqim)\n      }\n    },\n  })\n`]\n\n`### Collection\n\nCollections have `@bb:Collection-model`@ (a class reference) which simply specifies `#_childClass, `@bb:Collection-reset`@() is alike to `#assignChildren (`'Collection's `@bb:Collection-set`@() is entirely different though), `@bb:Collection-push`@(), `@bb:Collection-pop`@(), `@bb:Collection-shift`@(), `@bb:Collection-unshift`@() are shortcuts for `#nest() and the company of `#util (Sqimitive by default is not `#Ordered), `@bb:Model-clone()`@ is another shortcut for non-`#_owning lists. Models are keyed by their `@bb:Model-id`@ attribute value (or `@bb:Model-idAttribute`@) which are like `#_defaultKey().\n\n`[\n  var BackboneCollection = BackboneBase.extend('BackboneCollection', {\n    model: null,  // alias to _childClass; do not write to.\n    el: null,\n    idAttribute: 'id',\n\n    events: {\n      '=assignChildren': function (sup, resp, options) {\n        options = _.extend(options || {}, {eqFunc: this.idAttribute})\n        return sup(this, [resp, options])\n      },\n    },\n\n    _defaultKey: function (model) {\n      return model.get(this.idAttribute)\n    },\n\n    reset: function (models, options) {\n      if (!arguments.length) {\n        this.each(this.unlist, this)\n      } else {\n        this.assignChildren(models, {\n          eqFunc: this.idAttribute || 'id',\n          keepMissing: !('remove' in options) || !options.remove,\n        })\n      }\n\n      return this\n    },\n\n    push: function (model) {\n      this.nest(model)\n    },\n\n    unshift: function (model) {\n      this.nest(model)\n    },\n\n    pop: function () {\n      var model = this.last()\n      model && model.remove()\n      return model\n    },\n\n    shift: function () {\n      var model = this.first()\n      model && model.remove()\n      return model\n    },\n\n    toJSON: function () {\n      return this.invoke('get')\n    },\n\n    clone: function () {\n      if (this._owning) {\n        throw new Error('clone() will clear the original collection.')\n      }\n\n      var copy = new this.constructor(this.get())\n      this.each(function (child, key) { copy.nest(key, child) })\n      return copy\n    },\n  })\n`]\n\n`### Model\n\nModels' `@bb:Model-escape`@() and `@bb:Model-has`@() are shortcuts for `#get(). `@bb:Model-id`@ option (\"attribute\") is readable/writable as `[get('id')`]/`[set('id', ...)`] and also readable directly as `[obj.id`] (write attempts won't be caught nor will they change the \"real\" `'id).\n\n`[\n  var BackboneModel = BackboneBase.extend('BackboneModel', {\n    attributes: {}, // alias to _opt; do not write to.\n    defaults: {},   // alias to declaration-time _opt; do not write to.\n    id: null,       // alias to get('id'); do not write to.\n\n    _opt: {\n      id: null,\n    },\n\n    events: {\n      '-init': function () {\n        this.defaults = Sqimitive.Core.deepClone(this._opt)\n      },\n\n      init: function () {\n        this.attributes = this._opt\n      },\n\n      change_id: function (id) { this.id = id },\n    },\n\n    toJSON: function () {\n      return this.get()\n    },\n\n    escape: function (opt) {\n      return _.escape(this.get(opt))\n    },\n\n    has: function (opt) {\n      return this.get(opt) != null    // undefined or null.\n    },\n  })\n`]\n\n`### View\n\nViews have `@bb:View-setElement`@(), `@bb:View-delegateEvents`@() and `@bb:View-undelegateEvents`@() that are similar to `@jQuery.attach()`@.\n\n`[\n  var BackboneView = BackboneBase.extend('BackboneView', {\n    el: null,     // el must remain a wrapped jQuery node in Sqimitive.\n    $el: null,    // alias to el; do not write to.\n\n    events: {\n      init: function () {\n        this.$el = this.el\n      },\n    },\n\n    setElement: function (el) {\n      this.undelegateEvents() // unnecessary since attach() does this already.\n      this.el = this.$el = el\n      return this.attach()    // only binds events if el has no parent.\n    },\n\n    delegateEvents: function (events) {\n      this.elEvents = events\n      return this.attach()    // only binds events if el has no parent.\n    },\n\n    undelegateEvents: function () {\n      this.el.off('.sqim-' + this._cid)\n    },\n  })\n`]\n\n`### Babysitting Models\n\nOne of the most common problems when developing a complex client-side app is keeping track of multiple Models or of a Collection connected to a particular View. When a new Model appears you need to create and display a new nested View; when it's removed - its View should go away; when Model attributes change the View should be updated (and this case is often but not always handled by that Model's specific View).\n\nOn top of that, when parent View acquires another Collection it should properly detach itself from the previously assigned Collection, attach to the new object and repopulate itself.\n\nThings get even more complex with asynchronous operations - sometimes the user gets ahead of his network packets and you don't want the user interface to tangle up.\n\nSqimitive addresses all of these challenges:\n\n`* Attach/detach event handlers to the related Collection with `#autoOff() or `[off(collection)`] (`#off).\n`* Keep that Collection as an option (`@Base._opt`@) so once it changes you receive `[change_collection(newCol, oldCol)`] event (`#change_OPT).\n`* Make sure only proper Collections are assigned by checking the value-to-be-set in `[normalize_collection(newCol)`] (`#normalize_OPT).\n`* Listen to new Models with `#on on `@Base.nestEx`@ (`[on('+nestEx')`]) and to gone Models on `#unnested.\n`* Listen to changed Models via `#_childEvents: set it to `[['change']`] and listen to `[on('.change')`].\n`* Automatically manage nested Views' connections to DOM with `'attachPath (`@jQuery._opt`@) and `@jQuery.attach()`@. Quite often there's no need for `#render() at all.\n\nSample code below demonstrates this in practice. It's a good idea to make a class handling this basic logic and reuse it throughout your project.\n\n`[\n  var ParentView = Sqimitive.jQuery.extend({\n    _childClass: ChildView,\n\n    _opt: {\n      collection: null,   // Collection.Foo.\n    },\n\n    normalize_collection: function (newCol) {\n      if (!(newCol instanceof Collection.Foo)) {\n        throw new Error('Bad collection type.')\n      } else {\n        return newCol\n      }\n    },\n\n    change_collection: function (newCol, oldCol) {\n      // Unbind self from the old collection, if any.\n      oldCol && oldCol.off(this)\n\n      // Clear existing nested Views, if any (this form only works if _owning).\n      this.invoke('remove')\n\n      // Set up the link to the new collection.\n      if (newCol) {\n        this.autoOff(newCol, {\n          nestEx: function (options) {\n            options.changed && this._modelAdded(options.child)\n          },\n          unnested: '_modelRemoved',\n          // Requires that the collection declares _childEvents: ['change'].\n          '.change': '_modelChanged',\n        })\n\n        // Populate with the existing models.\n        newCol.each(this._modelAdded, this)\n      }\n    },\n\n    _modelAdded: function (model) {\n      // This is the place where a new View gets created, nested and linked to\n      // the model. First argument to nest() is view's parent key by which it\n      // can be retrieved later. Model's ID is usually unique so use it if you\n      // have one. If this key already existed then that View will be removed\n      // and replaced with the new View.\n      var view = this.nest(model.get('id'), new this._childClass({\n        model: model,\n        attachPath: '.models',\n      }))\n\n      // Append view.el to this.el.find('.models') and bind its DOM event\n      // listeners. This won't render() the View but it might listen to\n      // 'attach' and call render() automatically.\n      view.attach()\n      // ...If it doesn't auto-render - no big deal:\n      view.render()\n    },\n\n    _modelRemoved: function (model) {\n      var view = this.nested(model.get('id'))\n      if (view) {\n        // Removes view's DOM element from this.el and unnests view from this\n        // children. This essentially unbinds view's DOM listeners and its\n        // Sqimitive listeners on the parent (this).\n        view.remove()\n      } else {\n        console.warn('Removed a Model with no nested View.')\n      }\n    },\n\n    _modelChanged: function (model) {\n      // Update something when model's options change...\n    },\n  })\n`]\n\nThe above code can be used like this:\n\n`[\n  var col = new Collection.Foo\n  col.nest(new Model.Foo({id: 1}))\n\n  new ParentView({collection: col, attachPath: 'body'})\n    // Gets created with one nested ChildView (existing Model in col).\n    // ParentView's el is appended to <body>.\n\n  col.nest(new Model.Foo({id: 2}))\n    // New ChildView nested. Now col.length and ParentView's length are 2.\n\n  col.nested(2).remove()\n    // Removed the just nested View after retrieving it by its key (\"id\" here).\n\n  col.nested(1).set('smth', 'foo')\n    // The '.change' event got fired on ParentView.\n`]\n\n\n","start":{"line":172,"column":-1,"offset":7273},"end":{"line":649,"column":-1,"offset":29283},"forced":null,"modifiers":[],"file":"HELP.chem"},"797":{"type":"page","id":797,"name":"ov","comment":"`! +pg=ov +pgo=-3\n\n`# Anatomy of a Sqimitive\n\nObjects in Sqimitive are homogeneous and mostly deal with other \"sqimitives\" only - the basic building blocks provided by the library, the \"primitive\".\n\nEach sqimitive has three fundamental features that in different combinations cover an extremely wide range of tasks: `*`#opt options`*, `*`#chld children`* and `*`#evt events`*. Below is a quick high-level overview to demonstrate the main idea; consult the API documentation on `#Core, `#Base and others with hundreds of examples if you want to get all out of Sqimitive.\n\n`##opt Options\n\n` `*Options`* are `@bb:Model-attributes`@ in Backbone's terms - set of key/value pairs defined under `@Base._opt`@ which trigger events on `#change or access, can be normalized and can be virtual (i.e. you can write your accessor that won't correspond to a \"physical\", listed option). They are solely accessed via `#set() and `#get() methods to create a sort-of public object interface.\n\nSample code below defines a class with two options - `'isCompleted (boolean) and `'caption (string). When one of them is changed, the associated DOM node is updated (see the sample To-Do application for more: `@https://squizzle.me/js/sqimitive/demo/to-do.html`@).\n\n`[\n  var MyToDoItem = Sqimitive.jQuery.extend({\n    _opt: {\n      isCompleted: true,\n      caption: 'Do me at home!',\n    },\n\n    events: {\n      // When task becomes complete or incomplete its DOM element gets that\n      // class added or removed on the fly.\n      change_isCompleted: function (newValue) {\n        this.el.toggleClass('done', newValue)\n      },\n\n      change_caption: 'render',\n    },\n\n    // HTML template for this node's contents as used below.\n    _tpl: '<h3><%- caption %></h3>',\n\n    normalize_isCompleted: function (value) {\n      // Turn whatever is given as a new value for isCompleted into a boolean.\n      // If the result is identical to the current value - 'change' is not\n      // fired.\n      return !!value\n    },\n\n    // Trim whitespace around the caption.\n    normalize_caption: function (value) {\n      return _.trim(value)\n    },\n\n    render: function () {\n      // Retrieve the map of all options/values and pass them as variables to\n      // the template. Note that template() implementation differs in NoDash,\n      // Underscore and LoDash.\n      var vars = this.get()   // = {isCompleted: false, caption: 'foo'}\n      this.el.html(_.template(this._tpl, vars))\n    },\n  })\n`]\n\n`##chld Children\n\n` `*Children`* are zero or more \"sqimitives\" `#nested into zero or more parent \"sqimitives\". Their events may be forwarded to parent - but only while they are still part of that parent (`#_childEvents); upon removal they are automatically unbound (`#autoOff). When a child is added or removed its parent, if any, gets notified (`#unnested). Also, most of Underscore.js is available as methods to easily filter or transform children into native arrays or objects (`#util).\n\nParent sqimitives can be of two types: `*`#_owning`* (by default) and `*non-owning`*. First represent a typical tree where each child has exactly one `#_parent and which you can traverse the tree in either direction starting from any node. If you `#nest a child into another parent it's automatically removed from the former owner. Second type is more of a list where you can only traverse from the outside because a child doesn't know in what other sqimitives it might be listed in, if at all, and no automatic removal is done when a child becomes part of another parent.\n\nSample code below defines a to-do list that is meant for storing `[MyToDoItem`]s from the above example. Note that in Backbone you would have at least two classes: one `@bb:Collection`@ for storing the list of to-do items and one `@bb:View`@ for displaying that collection... Or, to be brutally honest, you would create four classes: a `@bb:Model`@ holding data of a single to-do item, a `@bb:View`@ displaying it, a `@bb:Collection`@ holding to-do items as a whole and another `@bb:View`@ holding the Collection holding the Models - and you still have to link each Model to its View and keep track of their events and DOM elements.\n\nIn Sqimitive you can still do all that but it's the author's opinion that such pure concepts are only good for academics and very large projects - most of the time you would rather have something more utilitarian and dirty, if you will. Sqimitive allows you a choice since everything is ultimately a primitive and can be \"purified\" to the point you need.\n\nNote that the hierarchy of sqimitives (defined by `#nest) doesn't necessary reflect the hierarchy in DOM (of `@jQuery.el`@) - `#_children can have their elements under their `#_parent's `'el or elsewhere, or not have DOM elements at all (as \"models\" do).\n\n`[\n  var MyToDoList = Sqimitive.jQuery.extend({\n    // Add extra protection against accidental foreign class being added as a\n    // child.\n    _childClass: MyToDoItem,\n    // Leading dash means \"listen before\" - see next section about events.\n    _childEvents: ['-change', 'change'],\n\n    events: {\n      // To avoid collisions between children-generated and self events those\n      // forwarded from children get prepended with a period. If you have\n      // another parent that is forwarding its child's children events then\n      // another period appears - e.g. '..change'. Think of this as of regular\n      // '../../path' notation where each period means \"one level above\".\n      '.-change': function (sqim, optName, newValue, currentValue) {\n        // Outputs something like \"To-do item's caption ... from foo to bar\".\n        console.log('To-do item\\'s ' + optName + ' is about to be changed' +\n                    ' from ' + currentValue + ' to ' + newValue)\n      },\n\n      '.change': function (sqim, optName, newValue, currentValue) {\n        console.log(optName + ' has changed to ' + newValue)\n      },\n    },\n\n    postInit: function () {\n      var itemOptions = {isCompleted: false, caption: 'Dummy item'}\n      var sqim = this.nest(new MyToDoItem(itemOptions))\n      sqim.set('caption', 'fire them!')\n      // Because of forwarded events two new messages have appeared in the\n      // console.\n\n      // Can also assign an explicit name (if omitted _cid is used).\n      this.nest('childName', new this._childClass)\n      // Can retrieve the object like this:\n      var sqim = this.nested('childName')\n      sqim.unnest()\n    },\n\n    // Use Underscore to retireve only children with isCompleted being false.\n    getIncomplete: function () {\n      // picker() gets inherited from Sqimitive.Core and is simply a function\n      // calling a method on the given object with given parameters. In other\n      // words, equivalent to ES6's: (o) => o.get('isCompleted') LoDash has a\n      // similar method called rearg().\n      return this.reject(MyToDoList.picker('get', 'isCompleted'))\n    },\n  })\n`]\n\n`##evt Events\n\n` `*Events`* are Squimitive's Swiss Army Knife to deal with everything from inheritance (OOP style - `#extend and `#mixIn) and prototyping (native JavaScript style) to dynamic property morphing and dispatching notifications in an Observer-like fashion. When defined upon class declaration handlers are \"`#fuse'd\" into the class (reducing their performance overhead), otherwise they work as regular event listeners that can be manipulated on run-time using `#on, `#off and others (for instance, they are automatically removed once a `#nested sqimitive is `#unnested).\n\nWhen you try to listen to an event and there is a method of the same name, Sqimitive turns that method into an event slot and the method itself becomes its first listener. This way every method is potentially an event that you can manipulate on run-time as well as upon declaration (`#events), working with nearly conventional OOP as found in languages like C and PHP while still utilizing the power of dynamic object manipulation as it's meant with JavaScript.\n\nLikewise, if there is no method when you define an event - Sqimitive creates it so that calling it actually triggers the event (`#firer). This way you can always invoke a method without knowing if it's a real function or an event trampoline, bridging the gap between the two.\n\nAn example to demonstrate how methods become events \"on demand\" (`#logEvents):\n`[\n  var MyBase = Sqimitive.Base.extend({\n    // render() is essentially a function, regular \"method\".\n    render: function () {\n      this.el.text('Hello!')\n    },\n  })\n\n  // What we're doing is calling a function. It's not an event and won't be\n  // caught by logEvents().\n  ;(new MyBase).render()\n\n  var MyChild = MyBase.extend({\n    events: {\n      render: function () {\n        this.el.append('...I extend...')\n      },\n    },\n  })\n\n  // Now we are in fact firing 'render' which is an event with two listeners:\n  // one from MyBase (called first) and another from MyChild. 'render' is fired\n  // whenever we call render() in MyChild and descendants, and for them\n  // logEvents() logs the call.\n  ;(new MyChild).render()\n\n  // POTENTIALLY WRONG:\n  var MyChile = MyChild.extend({\n    render: function () {\n      alert('Boom!')\n    },\n  })\n\n  // Now we're back to event-less render() - a mere function. Note that two\n  // former 'render' handlers are still present so if we attach a new listener\n  // to 'render' current render() (\"Boom\") will be prepended to the list of\n  // handlers as a 3rd handler and MyChile.render() itself will be replaced by\n  // firer('render'). It's a bad practice to supersede an \"evented\" function\n  // like this and usually indicates a mistake (forgetting that a method of the\n  // same name exists in some parent). Consequently, logEvents() here won't\n  // track anything. More on this below, in #evtconc.\n  ;(new MyChile).render()\n`]\n\nCompare Sqimitive-style inheritance (`#evtpf) and the traditional inheritance using `'__super__ (which still works in Sqimitive):\n`[\n  var MyBase = Sqimitive.Base.extend({\n    effect: function (arg) {\n      console.log('MyBase.effect(' + arg + ')')\n      return this\n    },\n  })\n\n  // Traditional JavaScript-OOP inheritance as supported by Backbone.\n  var JsOopSubclassing = Sqimitive.Base.extend({\n    // This way you override the inherited method, entirely.\n    effect: function (arg) {\n      return 'foo'\n    },\n\n    // Calling the inherited implementation...\n    effect: function (arg) {\n      console.log('pre-actions')\n      // We have to hardcode current class and method names, plus the call is\n      // quite long.\n      var result = JsOopSubclassing.__super__.effect.apply(this, arguments)\n      console.log('post-actions')\n      return result\n    },\n  })\n\n  // Event-oriented Sqimitive inheritance.\n  var SqimitiveSubclassing = Sqimitive.Base.extend({\n    events: {\n      // This is how you override the entire method in Sqimitive.\n      '=effect': function (sup, arg) {\n        return 'foo'\n      },\n\n      // ...and this is how you call the inherited implementation.\n      '=effect': function (sup, arg) {\n        console.log('pre-actions')\n        // No hardcoded class reference, concise calling format.\n        var result = sup(this, arguments)\n        console.log('post-actions')\n        return result\n      },\n\n      // However, such a full override is rarely needed - most often you only\n      // need to do something after the original method executes, keeping its\n      // return value.

Contrary to\n      // the common approach, Sqimitive offers no event namespaces (such as\n      // my.handler) used to unbind group of events - by-context lookup is\n      // available and it covers most of such use-cases (see below).\n      var id = this.on('event', handler)\n      this.off(id)\n\n      // You are free to use dots and colons in event names for your needs.\n      this.on('com.myapi.proc:group', handler)\n\n      // Slower but removes all bindings to the given context object among all\n      // events of this object in one go.\n      this.on('withContext', handler, context)\n      this.off(context)\n\n      // You can also clear all listeners to a particular event.\n      this.on('wipeEvent', handler)\n      this.off('wipeEvent')\n    },\n  })\n`]\n\n`##evtconc Events vs methods on extension\nAs demonstrated, method calls are often event triggers in disguise and so both `[obj.method()`] and `[obj.fire('method')`] work exactly the same way. However, there is a catch: when `#extend'ing a class or an object (`#mixIn) you can either add methods within the `#events property or list them as regular properties - and the latter is wrong. Compare:\n`[\n  // WRONG:\n  Sqimitive.Base.extend({\n    method: function () { ... }\n  })\n\n  // CORRECT:\n  Sqimitive.Base.extend({\n    events: {\n      '=method': function () { ... }\n    }\n  })\n`]\n\nThe first declaration is bad: it overrides the `#firer of `'method so if called as `[obj.method()`] it works as expected but as soon as a new handler is added with `#on/`#once/`#fuse the defined `'method() is moved to the beginning of handlers of the `'method event while retaining all previously defined handlers on that event (unlike with `'=method which removes old handlers entirely, see `#evtpf). Also, `[obj.fire('method')`] calls old (now concealed) handlers while `[obj.method()`] does not, with different side effects to the caller!\n\n` `*Follow this rule of a thumb:`* when introducing a method (or an event, which are very close things in Sqimitive) - declare it as a property; when overriding an existing method - always put it into `#events, without exceptions.\n\nBut then, if you want to be on the safe side you can declare all functions in `#events - they will work just like regular methods but you'll need a bit more typing (as the empty event prefix ignores return value - `#evtpf).\n\n`#vw Opening the views\n\nOptions, children and events compose 90% of what a sqimitive is. However, they all are mostly about logic and data; to make the user happy we should interact with him and present some visual information. This is when Views in MVC and Backbone terminology come into play.\n\nBy default, each sqimitive possesses a `*DOM element`* stored in `[this.el`] - a jQuery/Zepto object. It can be disabled for pure data classes (like Models or Collections) but if it isn't then such a node is automatically created by the constructor and assigned to this property (`@jQuery.el`@). Then you can make use of automatic binding of DOM events via `@jQuery.elEvents`@ and of convenient methods like `@jQuery.attach()`@, `@jQuery.remove()`@, `[this.$('sel.ector')`], `[bubble('eventForAllParents')`] and others.\n\nSample code below creates a simple login form. It stores data in its own `#opt'ions but, as you must know by now, Sqimitive allows you to extract it into another Model-like object if you need more abstraction in your application.\n\n`[\n  var MyFormView = Sqimitive.jQuery.extend({\n    // If omitted will create just a plain <div>.\n    el: {tag: 'form', action: 'javascript:void 0', className: 'login-form'},\n\n    _opt: {\n      login: '',\n      password: '',\n      remember: false,\n    },\n\n    elEvents: {\n      submit: function () {\n        var data = this.el.serializeArray()\n        $.each(data, _.bind(this.set, this))\n\n        $.ajax({\n          url: 'login',\n          type: 'POST',\n          data: data,\n          context: this,\n          success: this.loggedIn,\n          error: function () {\n            this.addClass('error')\n          },\n        })\n\n        return false\n      },\n\n      'change [name=remember]': function (e) {\n        this.set('remember', e.target.checked)\n      },\n\n      render: function () {\n        this.el.empty()\n          .append('<input name=login autofocus>')\n          .append('<input name=password type=password>')\n          .append('<input name=remember type=checkbox>')\n          .append('<button type=submit>Log In</button>')\n\n        this.update()\n      },\n    },\n\n    update: function () {\n      this.$('[name=login]').val(this.get('login'))\n      this.$('[name=password]').val(this.get('password'))\n      this.$('[name=remember]')[0].checked = this.get('remember')\n    },\n\n    // stub() is just a function that returns undefined (nothing). When it's\n    // used in place of a method and if that method becomes an event (getting a\n    // listener) then there's a small optimization - Sqimitive removes the old\n    // method entirely without adding it as a listener for that event.\n    //\n    // Alternatively, you could just leave this undefined and always use\n    // fire('loggedIn') but it's against Sqimitive conventions, more tricky and\n    // less obvious if you ever get a loggedIn() method that for any reason\n    // does something else.\n    loggedIn: Sqimitive.jQuery.stub,\n  })\n`]\n\nWe can use the above class as follows:\n\n`[\n  // A typical use case - just create a new form object along with its DOM\n  // element:\n  var sqim = new MyFormView({login: 'default@login'})\n\n  // Or if we have an existing container element - use it:\n  var sqim = new MyFormView({login: 'default@login', el: '#loginForm'})\n\n  // Then we can listen to new sqimitive's events like so:\n  sqim.on('loggedIn', function () { alert('Hello, ' + this.get('login')) })\n\n  // ...or morph it dynamically - just like good old JavaScript but better:\n  sqim.on('=render', function (sup) {\n    if (location.protocol != 'https:') {\n      this.el.text('Your connection is not secure!')\n    } else {\n      // Only show the form over HTTPS.\n      sup(this, arguments)\n    }\n  })\n\n  // This is not Sqimitive-way: it's long-winded, overrides whatever is already\n  // defined as render() including all event listeners (if 'render' is an event\n  // slot, see #evtconc) and hardcodes parent class name and return value...\n  // but if you don't mind that - use it, Sqimitive doesn't care.\n  sqim.render = function () {\n    if (location.protocol != 'https:') {\n      this.el.text('Your connection is not secure!')\n      return this\n    } else {\n      return MyFormView.render.apply(this, arguments)\n    }\n  }\n`]\n\n\n","start":{"line":650,"column":-1,"offset":29283},"end":{"line":1129,"column":-1,"offset":50807},"forced":null,"modifiers":[],"file":"HELP.chem"},"798":{"type":"page","id":798,"name":"ex","comment":"`! +pg=ex\n\n`# Examples, tips & tricks\n\nThis section is a collection of practical snippets and recipes demonstrating how Sqimitive addresses real-world, day-to-day problems.\n\n`## Figuring \"class name\"\n\nWith its concept of \"functions as first-class citizens\", JavaScript lacks any kind of \"class name\" references in instantiated objects. The best we can afford is duck-typing: if we see an object X having properties Y and Z the we `*suspect`* it's that kind of object (i.e. of that \"class\").\n\nQuite often, while debugging we need to figure what's the object we see, `*reliably`*. If your app has all Sqimitive classes defined under a certain object (like `'window - which is a bad practice - or `[window.MyApp`]) you can go through all prototypes on start-up and add some property, let's say \"sqClassName\", holding string reference to that prototype, like `[MyApp.Collections.FooBar`].\n\nFirst, let's override `@Core::extend()`@ with our own version that will mark each produced prototype so we know we're looking at something we have created:\n\n`[\n  var BaseSqimitive = Sqimitive.jQuery.extend()\n\n  BaseSqimitive.extend = function () {\n    var child = Sqimitive.jQuery.extend.apply(this, arguments)\n    // If you're strictly ES6+ then use Symbols.\n    child.sqIsClass = true\n\n    // If your classes are defined like AppRoot, AppRoot.View, AppRoot.View.Cart\n    // the following code will skip subclasses when extending a class:\n    //   AppRoot.OtherBaseView = AppRoot.View.extend()\n    // Without it OtherBaseView would get AppRoot.View.Cart as OtherBaseView.Cart.\n    for (var prop in this) {\n      if (/^[A-Z]/.test(prop) && typeof this[prop] == 'function' && this[prop].sqIsClass) {\n        delete child[prop]\n      }\n    }\n\n    return child\n  }\n`]\n\nNow on start-up we can go through all classes and add `'sqClassName like `[View.Cart`]:\n\n`[\n  // Define classes above or wrap the following into $().\n  ;(function (cls, prefix) {\n    for (var key in cls) {\n      var member = cls[key]\n      if (/[A-Z]/.test(key[0]) && typeof member == 'function' && member.sqIsClass) {\n        member.prototype.sqClassName = prefix + key\n        arguments.callee(member, prefix + key + '.')\n      }\n    }\n  })(window.MyAppRoot, '')\n  // Replace MyAppRoot reference with your root.\n`]\n\nHere's an example of what you get:\n\n`* `*`[MyAppRoot.BaseView`]`*`[.sqClassName = 'BaseView'`]\n`* `*`[MyAppRoot.BaseView.SubView`]`*`[.sqClassName = 'BaseView.SubView'`]\n`* `*`[MyAppRoot.BaseModel`]`*`[.sqClassName = 'BaseModel'`]\n\nThis technique allows attaching custom info to every class (prototype) but is fairly slow to enable in production. It's recommended that you pass your \"class name\" (or other string) directly to `@Core::extend()`@ - it's zero-overhead and will appear in debugger too:\n`[\n  MyAppRoot.BaseView.SubView = MyAppRoot.BaseView.extend('BaseView.SubView', {\n    // ...\n  })\n\n  // MyAppRoot.BaseView.SubView is a constructor, i.e. a function, and so has a\n  // name property:\n  MyAppRoot.BaseView.SubView.name     //=> 'BaseView.SubView'\n    // some browsers even show the function's name when you hover or print such\n    // an object\n\n  var sqim = new MyAppRoot.BaseView.SubView\n  sqim.constructor.name               //=> 'BaseView.SubView'\n`]\n\n`## Countdown class\n\nSometimes you get a number of actions to be completed before performing a specific task. For example, you need to preload a bunch of images and work on them once they are all ready. You can use native `'Promise objects or their \"fractal\" form (`@Sqimitive\\Async`@), or you can write a simple class for counter-based synchronization:\n\n`[\n  // We need no associated el object so we extend Base and don't depend on\n  // jQuery.\n  var Countdown = Sqimitive.Base.extend('Countdown', {\n    _opt: {\n      count: 0,\n      cx: null,\n    },\n\n    events: {\n      init: function (opt, onDone) {\n        // This way dec() and inc() calls will always happen on this object\n        // instance.\n        _.bindAll(this, 'dec', 'inc')\n        onDone && (this.done = onDone)\n      },\n    },\n\n    done: Sqimitive.Base.stub,\n    error: Sqimitive.Base.stub,\n\n    dec: function () {\n      if (--this._opt.count == 0) {\n        this.done.call(this.get('cx') || this)\n      } else if (this._opt.count < 0) {\n        console && console.warn('Countdown below zero.')\n      }\n\n      return this\n    },\n\n    inc: function () {\n      ++this._opt.count\n      return this\n    },\n  })\n`]\n\nIts usage is straightforward:\n\n`[\n  var images = ['pic1.jpg', 'pic2.jpg']\n\n  var countdown = new Countdown({count: images.length}, function () {\n    // Executed when all images have been loaded.\n  });\n\n  // Start loading images.\n  _.each(images, function (path) {\n    var img = new Image\n    // dec() is bound to the instance so can be called with an arbitrary\n    // context.\n    img.onload = countdown.dec\n    img.src = path\n  })\n`]\n\n`## Activity pipeline class\n\nAt other times, you might need complex synchronization, like `@Sqimitive\\Async`@ or Promises but with multiple stages that should be easy to override, e.g. in a subclass or by outside listeners.\n\nFor example, imagine a `'Page class. Its objects occupy all available window space and when switched from one to another must perform a visual effect (e.g. slide or fade). Effect can be changed in specific `'Page subclass, there are various actions to perform when it's done (e.g. freeing of data), and there are also conditions when pages should not be changed - e.g. when it's busy or asking for confirmation. And it must be singular - we don't want effects or other phases overlap.\n\nBelow is a helper class that represents a pipeline of actions: the process begins with `'prereq(), proceeds to `'passthru(), then to `'transition() and finishes with `'done(). If the action has been stopped then `'cancel() occurs at any point. They are all methods but can be turned into events by overriding them with `#on() according to Sqimitive's event model (`#evt).\n\nAn instance of this class can have only one stage active at a given time and so it ignores multiple `'start() calls until `'done() or `'cancel() are reached. `'done callbacks given during a single run are retained and called upon completion.\n\n`[\n  var Activity = Sqimitive.Base.extend('Activity', {\n    _done: [],\n\n    _opt: {\n      cx: null,\n      active: false,\n    },\n\n    // (1) Proceed to 'passthru' if the activity can be performed (e.g. if\n    // popup window can be closed without explicit user choice), otherwise\n    // proceed to 'cancel'.\n    prereq: function () {\n      this.passthru()\n    },\n\n    // (2) Proceed to 'transition' if need to perform any action (e.g. if a\n    // window is visible, not hidden) or to 'done'.\n    passthru: function () {\n      this.transition()\n    },\n\n    // (3) Proceed to 'done' when all actions are finished.\n    transition: function () {\n      this.done()\n    },\n\n    // (4) Invokes all pending callbacks.\n    done: function () {\n      var funcs = this._done.splice(0)\n      this.set('active', false)\n      this._invoke(funcs)\n    },\n\n    // (2) Remove all on-done callbacks (not possible to perform the activity).\n    cancel: function () {\n      this._done = []\n      this.set('active', false)\n    },\n\n    _invoke: function (list) {\n      _.each(list, function (item) {\n        try {\n          item[0].call(item[1])\n        } catch (e) {\n          console && console.error('Activity callback exception: ' + e)\n        }\n      })\n    },\n\n    // If currently active func will be called upon completion.

Notable exceptions are `'pick()/`'omit(): in Underscore and NoDash the iterator may be a function or a list of property names, in LoDash - list only.\n\nIf doing several transformations one after another consider `#_() which allows chaining.\n\n`#-unordered\n`* `'each(), `'filter(), etc. can iterate in any order\n`* `'find(), `'first(), etc. can return an arbitrary child\n`* `'indexOf(), etc. may change result on each call\n`* `'reduceRight() may not fold from the end\n\nFor this reason some methods are only available when mixing-in `@Sqimitive\\Ordered`@ which guarantees iteration order.\n\nThe `'iterator argument may be followed by call context (`'cx) which defaults to the sqimitive if omitted.\n\n`## Methods working with children keys (`#nested())\n`[\n  iterator = function (Sqimitive child, string parentKey)\n`]\nExample: `[sqim.keys()`] -> `[_.keys(sqim.nested())`].\n\nMethods available for `@Sqimitive\\Base`@ subclasses:\n\n`* `@no@keys`@`[()`] - returns an array of all children keys (of `#_parentKey-s if `#_owning)\n`* `@no@omit`@`[(keys | key[, key, ...] | iterator[, cx])`] - the opposite of `'pick(), children with mismatching keys\n`* `@no@pick`@`[(keys | key[, key, ...] | iterator[, cx])`] - returns object of children with matching keys: `[\n      sqim.pick(['k1', 'k2'])   //=> {k1: child1, k2: child2}\n      sqim.pick('k1', 'k2')\n      sqim.pick(child => child.get('enabled'))\n   `]\n\n   The `'iterator form is similar to `'filter() but returns `[{key: child, ...}`], not `[[child, ...]`].\n\n   Warning: keys are always strings (see `@Base.nestEx()`@). `[sqim.pick(1)`] always returns `[[]`] - use `[sqim.pick('1')`].\n\n`## Methods working on children positions (`#slice())\n`[\n  iterator = function (Sqimitive child, int index)\n`]\nExample: `[sqim.sample()`] -> `[_.sample(sqim.slice())`].\n\n`#-unordered\nIf `@Sqimitive\\Ordered`@ is not used, `'index is an arbitrary number sequential in this particular call to the utility method; `[sqim.filter((c, i) => sqim.slice(i, 1))`] may produce undefined behaviour. For `#Ordered, `'index is stable and can be given to `#at() or `#slice().\n\nAttention: `'forEach() and other methods here work with child indexes, not keys! Obtain keys by `#_parentKey if the collection is `#_owning, or by `#findKey(), or do `[_.each(col.nested(), (sqim, key) => ...)`]. For `#Ordered, can also use `[at(index).key`].\n\nMethods available for `@Sqimitive\\Base`@ subclasses:\n\n`* `@no@chunk`@`[(length)`] - returns an array of arrays of `'length members each (except last): `[[child1, child2], [child3, child4], [child5]`]\n`* `@no@includes`@`[(sqim)`] - returns `'true if there's a nested `'sqim instance (similar to `#nested())\n`* `@no@countBy`@`[(iterator[, cx])`] - same as `'groupBy() but values are group lengths: `[{group1: 3, group2: 1, ...}`]\n`* `@no@difference`@`[(array[, array, ...])`] - same as `'without() but accepts one or more arrays\n`* `@no@forEach`@`[(iterator[, cx])`] - calls `'iterator on every child; returns nothing; alias: `'each()\n`* `@no@every`@`[(predicate[, cx])`] - returns `'true if for every child `'predicate returned a truthy value\n`* `@no@filter`@`[(predicate[, cx])`] - returns array of children for which `'predicate returned a truthy value; see `'pick() which returns an object\n`* `@no@find`@`[(predicate[, cx])`] - returns the first child for which `'predicate returned a truthy value or `'undefined\n`* `@no@groupBy`@`[(iterator[, cx])`] - returns an object with arrays of children for which `'iterator returned the same string (the object's keys are those strings): `[{group1: [child1, child3], group2: [...]}`]\n`* `@no@indexBy`@`[(iterator[, cx])`] - same as `'groupBy() but expects strings to be unique; returns `[{group1: child1, group2: child2, ...}`]; warning: missing from LoDash\n`* `@no@intersection`@`[(array[, array, ...])`] - returns an array of children listed in any of the given arrays\n`* `@no@invoke`@`[(method[, arg1, arg2, ...])`] - calls `'method of each child, giving it the passed `[arg`]uments; returns an array with results of every call; see `'map() which calls an iterator instead; warning: LoDash's works differently, do not use\n`* `@no@map`@`[(iterator[, cx])`] - returns an array with results of calling `'iterator for every child; similar to `'invoke() but doesn't call children's methods\n`* `@no@max`@`[(iterator[, cx])`] - ranks all children by calling `'iterator and returns the \"highest\" one\n`* `@no@min`@`[(iterator[, cx])`] - same as `'max() but returns the \"lowest\" child\n`* `@no@partition`@`[(predicate)`] - returns an array of two arrays: first with children matching `'predicate, second - not matching\n`* `@no@pluck`@`[(prop)`] - returns array of values of the `'prop property of every child; warning: missing from LoDash\n\n   `'pluck() is hardly useful in Sqimitive since public properties are usually within `@Base._opt`@ and picking protected \"_properties\" has limited utility.

This is sometimes desirable (to override the parent's\n handler), sometimes not (then use a unique `'.ns suffix):\n[\n   var Base = Sqimitive.Base.extend({\n     elEvents: {\n       click: function () { alert(\"Click-click-click!') },\n     },\n   })\n\n   var ChildA = Base.extend({\n     elEvents: {\n       click: function () { alert(\"Overridden!') },\n     },\n   })\n\n   var ChildB = Base.extend({\n     elEvents: {\n       'click.new-in-child-B': function () { alert(\"Combined!') },\n     },\n   })\n\n   // in ChildA, 'click' has 1 listener (Base's dropped)\n   // in ChildB, 'click' has 2 listeners (Base's and ChildB's)\n]\n\n## Mix-in inheritance\n\n `'mixIns is applied before setting other properties which allows\n extending mix-ins themselves (later mix-ins override preceding just like\n with normal inheritance on classes). For example:\n[\n   var ParentMixIn = {\n     someEvent: function () { /* parent */ },\n   ]\n\n   var ChildMixIn = {\n     mixIns: [ParentMixIn],\n     events: {\n       someEvent: function () { /* child */ },\n     },\n   }\n\n   var myClass = Sqimitive.Base.extend({\n     mixIns: [ChildMixIn],\n   })\n\n   // myClass had ParentMixIn added, then ChildMixIn, and now has two\n   // listeners on someEvent\n]\n `'ParentMixIn could also have the `'mixIns property to specify its own\n parent.\n\n In the above example, the mix-in specified its parent, which is usually\n intuitive. Still, it could be specified in the final class' `'mixIns\n alone:\n[\n   var ParentMixIn = {\n     someEvent: function () { /* parent */ },\n   ]\n\n   var ChildMixIn = {\n     // mixIns property is missing.\n     events: {\n       someEvent: function () { /* child */ },\n     },\n   }\n\n   var myClass = Sqimitive.Base.extend({\n     // Added ParentMixIn in front of ChildMixIn.\n     mixIns: [ParentMixIn, ChildMixIn],\n   })\n\n   // or (equivalent, no mixIns property, mixIn() calls instead):\n   var myClass = Sqimitive.Base.extend()\n   myClass.mixIn(ParentMixIn)\n   myClass.mixIn(ChildMixIn)\n\n   // or (equivalent for a particular object instance):\n   var myClass = Sqimitive.Base.extend()\n   var obj = new myClass\n   obj.mixIn(ParentMixIn)\n   obj.mixIn(ChildMixIn)\n\n   // in any case, MyClass (or obj) has 'someEvent' firer() with\n   // 2 listeners: of ParentMixIn and of ChildMixIn\n]\n\n ` `*Warning:`* calling `'mixIn() in `'finishMixIn() would have a\n different effect. If `'ChildMixIn were defined as follows then `'MyClass\n or `'obj would have `'someEvent not as a `#firer() but as the\n `'ParentMixIn's function (because it was mixed-in after `'ChildMixIn and\n overrode its `'events handler):\n[\n   var ChildMixIn = {\n     finishMixIn: function (newClass) {\n       newClass.mixIn(ParentMixIn)\n     },\n     events: {\n       someEvent: function () { /* child */ },\n     },\n   }\n]\n\n This will override the handler introduced in the declaration of `'Class\n for the same reason - `'MixIn is added to `'Class after `'Class' own\n fields:\n[\n   var MixIn = {\n     some: function () { ... },\n   }\n\n   var Class = Sqimitive.Base.extend({\n     events: {\n       some: function () { ... },\n     }\n   })\n\n   Class.mixIn(MixIn)\n]\n This is the correct way (using `'mixIns property when `#extend()'ing\n `'Class):\n[\n   var MixIn = {\n     some: function () { ... },\n   }\n\n   var Class = Sqimitive.Base.extend({\n     mixIns: [MixIn],\n     events: {\n       some: function () { ... },\n     }\n   })\n]\n\n## Edge cases\n See the source code for details.\n* Given a base class `'B and subclass `'C, adding mix-ins to `'B after `'C\n  has been `#extend()'ed from `'B when `'C declares `#events will lead to\n  `'C not having `#events of the newly mixed-in objects of `'B.\n* Declaration-time `#events of `'B are `#fuse()'d and their `'eobj-s are\n  shared among all subclasses of `'B and should not be changed (list of\n  events may change, just not properties of inherited handlers): `[\n    var ClassB = Sqimitive.Core.extend({\n      events: {change: 'render'},\n    })\n\n    ClassB.prototype._events.change[0].post    //=> undefined\n\n    var ClassC = ClassB.extend()\n    ClassC.prototype._events.change[0].post = function () { ... }\n    ClassB.prototype._events.change[0].post    //=> Function\n\n    // In this version instances' _events are deepClone()'d so changing it\n    // (not the prototype) doesn't affect other classes/objects:\n    var obj = new ClassC\n    obj._events.change[0].post = 'foo'\n    ClassB.prototype._events.change[0].post    //=> still Function\n  `]","start":{"line":2128,"column":4,"offset":79537},"end":{"line":2236,"column":4,"offset":84243},"forced":null,"modifiers":[],"file":"main.js"},"948":{"type":"func","id":948,"name":"fire","comment":"! `, +fna=function ( event [, args [, inBatch]] )\n\n#+tag_Events\n* `@Core.fire()`@\n#\n\n Triggers an event giving `'args as parameters to all registered\n listeners.

It receives a callable `'sup\n  of form `[function (this, args)`] which it may call or not (alike to\n  calling `'super in Java). `[sup.name`] equals plain event name, handy\n  with comma notation. If it returns `'undefined the current event return\n  value is unchanged.\n\n  First argument of `'sup is the context (normally the object that\n  initiated the event, i.e. the handler's own `'this). Second argument is\n  an array of arguments the overridden handlers receive. The handler may\n  change these arguments to trick the underlying (wrapped) handlers into\n  believing the event received a different set of data or it can pass the\n  `'arguments object that the handler itself has received - in this case\n  `[args[0]`] (which is `'sup) is removed and the rest is given to the\n  underlying handlers.\n\n  `? `[\n       // sup.name == 'someEvent'.\n       '=someEvent': function (sup, a1, a2) {\n         // Passes original context and arguments unchanged.\n         return sup(this, arguments)\n         // Identical to above but longer - sup() removes itself from the\n         // first argument.\n         return sup(this, _.rest(arguments))\n         // Not identical to above - if event was given >2 arguments they\n         // will be omitted here but passed as is by above.\n         return sup(this, [a1, a2])\n         // Changes first argument and omits 3rd and other arguments (if\n         // given).\n         return sup(this, [1, a2])\n         // Gives no arguments at all to the underlying handlers.\n         return sup(this)\n         // Passes sup verbatim because removal doesn't happen for array.\n         return sup(this, [sup])\n       },\n     `]\n\n  Note: old handlers are not technically \"removed\" - they are kept around\n  and restored if the `'=wrapping handler is removed so treat this prefix\n  like any other.

See the note on ev__ danger in on().\n       //'-unnest': 'autoOff',\n\n       // WRONG: ES6 'this' is bound to whatever context is calling\n       // extend(), see #es6this:\n       '-unnest': () => this.autoOff(),\n\n       // CORRECT:\n       '-unnest': function () {\n         this.autoOff()\n       },\n\n       // CORRECT: masked version:\n       '-unnest': 'autoOff-',\n     },\n   })\n  `]\n\n  Gotcha with the above usage: if you hook using `#autoOff() in `'init()\n  then those hooks will be removed as soon as the sqimitive is nested\n  anywhere because `@Base.nestEx()`@ calls `#unnest(). Consider hooking in\n  `#owned() if the class is guaranteed to become nested prior to actual\n  usage, or check for set `#_parent in `'-unnest before calling\n  `#autoOff().\n\n As a general rule, `#autoOff() is not used for permanently connected\n objects, i.e. ones that are destroyed at the same time as `'this. Such\n objects are typically set to \"_protected\" properties and `#init'ialized\n during construction:\n[\n   var MyGame = Sqimitive.Base.extend({\n    // Created together with MyGame and only referenced by MyGame:\n     _timer: null,\n\n     events: {\n       init: function () {\n         this._timer = new MyTimer({interval: 1000})\n         this._timer.on({expired:  () => alert(\"Time's up!\")})\n           // on() instead of autoOff({expired: ...})\n       },\n     },\n   })\n]\n\n? `#autoOff() only really calls `'on and `'off methods on `'sqim and can\n  be used with non-sqimitives if their signatures are compatible. For\n  example, jQuery's are partially compatible: `@jq:on`@() is usable (it\n  ignores `'cx but you can `'bind() or use ES6 arrow functions) while\n  `@jq:off()`@ is not:\n  `[\n    // Tracking:\n    this.autoOff($('body'), [\n      'onclick.' + this._cid,\n      // Need to bind() or use => as jQuery doesn't accept context object.\n      function (e) {\n        this.clicked(e.target)\n      }.bind(this),\n    ])\n\n    // Untracking:\n    this.autoOff(function (el) {\n      if (el instanceof $) {\n        el.off('.' + this._cid)\n        // Giving true removes object from the list without calling off().\n        this.autoOff(el, true)\n      }\n\n      // Or, one-liner:\n      ;(el instanceof $) && this.autoOff(el, true).off('.' + this._cid)\n    })\n  `]\n\n#-unnestedoff\n Because of this, there's no need to track and explicitly unsubscribe from\n children (regardless of `#_owning):\n[\n   var MyClass = Sqimitive.Base.extend({\n     events: {\n       init: function () {\n         var child = this.nest(new MyClass.Child)\n         this.autoOff(child, {changed: 'recalc'})\n       },\n\n       unnested: function (sqim) {\n         this.autoOff(sqim)\n       },\n     },\n\n     recalc: ...\n   })\n]\n The above is redundant and can be simplified, provided that the context\n given to `'on() is `'this as below:\n[\n   var MyClass = Sqimitive.Base.extend({\n     events: {\n       init: function () {\n         var child = this.nest(new MyClass.Child)\n         // this (_parent) will call off(this) on child when child is unnested().\n         child.on('changed', 'recalc', this)\n       },\n     },\n\n     recalc: ...\n   })\n]\n If you are hooking all children then use `#_childEvents to further\n simplify the task:\n[\n   var MyGame = Sqimitive.Base.extend({\n     _childEvents: ['changed'],\n\n     events: {\n       '.changed': 'recalc',\n     },\n\n     recalc: ...\n   })\n]\n\n# Garbage collection\n ` `#autoOff() prevents `'sqim from being garbage-collected by creating a\n reference from `'this to `'sqim. (`'WeakSet would be a solution if only\n it supported enumeration.)\n\n Normally, `[sqim.on(..., this)`] results in a reference to `'this being\n stored in `'sqim so that if `'sqim is not referenced anywhere else (e.g.\n it is not `#nest'ed) then it will be freed even if `'this remains alive.\n\n However, `#autoOff() additionally lists `'sqim in the `'_autoOff `'Set of\n `'this, creating a two-way link; now both `'sqim and `'this may only be\n freed together. Imagine a long-term \"server\" object (`'this) and\n short-term \"clients\" (`'sqim): `'this-server `#autoOff()-s (tracks) new\n `'sqim-client, then `#unnest()-s the latter at some point. Even though\n clients are not referenced anywhere except server's `'_autoOff, they will\n be kept alive until the server itself is destroyed.\n\n Addressing this is application-specific but one common way is to hook\n `'sqim's `#unnest (or `@Base.remove()`@) and remove it from `'_autoOff\n (`'this = server):\n[\n  this.autoOff(client, {\n    ...,\n    remove: function () {\n      this.autoOff(client)\n    },\n  })\n]","start":{"line":3069,"column":4,"offset":118652},"end":{"line":3125,"column":4,"offset":120295},"forced":null,"modifiers":[],"file":"main.js"},"959":{"type":"func","id":959,"name":"fuse","comment":"! `, +fna=function ( event, func[, cx] )\n\n#+tag_Events\n* `@Core.fuse()`@\n#\n\n Registers a single permanent event handler.\n\n Unlike with `#on() and `#once(), this handler cannot be removed with\n `#off().\n\n> event string `- a single event reference (no comma notation)\n> func function`, string `- masked method name (`#expandFunc())\n> cx object`, null/omitted use `'this `- the context for `'func\n\n= object `- an internal event registration object (`'eobj) that should be\n  discarded\n\n ` `#fuse() is a low-level method.

Order\n  within a group is guaranteed but order of groups is an internal detail\n  that should not be relied upon.\n\n? Consider an object with `'width and `'height `@Base._opt`@'ions bound to\n  a DOM node:\n  `[\n  var Rect = new Sqimitive.jQuery.extend({\n    _opt: {width: 0, height: 0},\n    events: {\n      change_width: '_recalc',\n      change_height: '_recalc',\n    },\n    _recalc: function () {\n      var w = this.get('width')\n      var h = this.get('height')\n      this.el.css({width: w, height: h})\n    },\n  })\n  `]\n  Calling `#set() would trigger two pairs of events:\n  `[\n  var obj = new Rect\n  obj.set('width', 10)\n    // fires change_width and change\n    // obj's options = {width: 10, height: 0}\n    // el's size = 10*0\n  obj.set('height', 20)\n    // fires change_height and change\n    // obj's options = {width: 10, height: 20}\n    // el's size = 10*20\n  `]\n  As seen, `'el would undergo two dimension changes of which the first is\n  redundant because after `'width the caller immediately supplies\n  `'height. In contrast, doing so in a `#batch:\n  `[\n   obj.batch(null, function () {\n     obj.set('width', 10)\n     obj.set('height', 20)\n   })\n     // fires change_width, change, change_height, change - all after\n     // the batch'ed function returns; change_width sets el's size to\n     // 10*20, as does change_height\n  `]\n  There are still two dimension changes (`'_recalc calls) but the second\n  sets the same size and is optimized by the browser.\n\n  If `'_recalc were doing heavy calculations, it could skip them by using\n  an internal option like so:\n  `[\n  var Rect = new Sqimitive.jQuery.extend({\n    _opt: {width: 0, height: 0, _recalced: ''},\n    events: {\n      change_width: '_ifRecalc',\n      change_height: '_ifRecalc',\n      change__recalced: '_recalc',\n    },\n    _ifRecalc: function () {\n      this.set('_recalced', this.get('width') + '*' + this.get('height'))\n    },\n    _recalc: function () { /* as above */ },\n  })\n  `]\n\n?

However, with a naive\n implementation handling `'change_original would trigger `'change_linked,\n then `'change of `'linked and only then - `'change of `'original.\n\n This would be also a problem if changing the same option from within its\n own event handler because `'change with the new value would be fired\n first (since `#set() was called last), then when the original `#set()\n returns it would also fire `'change but this time with the original (now\n old!) value.\n\n Notwithstanding, rarely a handler must be notified of the change\n immediately (sort of \"out of band data\"). `#batch() calls listeners whose\n event name starts with `'^ immediately after `'func returns, even if\n there are events of earlier-created batches yet to be dispatched. While\n normal listeners can be seen as an asynchronous event bus, `'^ are closer\n to direct function calls.\n\n For example, let's assume two objects: one an array of 2D points, another\n its index (array of points on the given Y axis). The index must be kept\n in sync so that clients accessing it at any point in time see no\n discrepancies with the main array (the only exception we allow is inside\n the same `#batch() `'func).\n\n[\n    var Points = Sqimitive.Base.extend({\n      points: [],\n\n      add: function (point) {\n        this.points.push(point)\n        this.batch(null, id => this._batch.push(['added', point]))\n      },\n\n      added: Sqimitive.Core.stub,\n    })\n\n    var Index = Sqimitive.Base.extend({\n      byY: {},\n\n      events: {\n        init: function (opt) {\n          this.autoOff(opt.points, {\n            added: '_added',\n            //'^added': '_added',\n          })\n        },\n      },\n\n      _added: function (point) {\n        (this.byY[point.y] || (this.byY[point.y] = [])).push(point)\n      },\n    })\n\n    var points = new Points\n    var index = new Index({points})\n    points.add({x: 0, y: 0})\n      // index.byY = {0: [{...}]}\n    points.add({x: 1, y: 1})\n      // index.byY = {0: [{...}], 1: [{...}]}\n]\n\n The above implementation works but at the first glance only:\n[\n    var points = new Points\n    var index = new Index({points})\n\n    points.on('change_foo', function () {\n      console.dir(index.byY)      // (1)\n      points.add({x: 2, y: 2})\n      console.dir(index.byY)      // (2)\n    })\n\n    points.add({x: 0, y: 0})\n    points.set('foo', 123)\n    console.dir(index.byY)        // (3)\n]\n\n Both (1) and (2) output the same result: `[{0}`] while (3) outputs\n `[{0, 2}`]. Why output of (2) is the same as of (3)? Because `#ifSet()\n uses `#batch, it delays dispatching events of other batches (`'added in\n our case) until its own events are finished. `'change_foo calls `'add()\n which creates a `#batch (queued after the currently executing `#ifSet's\n batch) and pushes `'added to it (to be dispatched after `[set('foo')`]\n returns, hence (3) showing expected result). In contrast, if `'Index\n hooks `['^added'`] then it becomes exempt from this delay and causes\n `'_added() to be called after `[points.add({x: 2, y: 2})`] returns (or,\n precisely, upon returning from `'func `[id => ...`] given to `'batch()\n inside `'add()) and the index to be updated.\n\n `'^ makes it \"closer\" to direct function call but not exactly that: such\n handler is called once the batch closes (`'func returns), not once a\n corresponding event if queued (\"function is called\"). Below, `'add() runs\n inside an already active batch so no index update takes place then:\n[\n    points.batch(null, function () {\n      points.add({x: 3, y: 3})\n        // points._batch = [['added', {x: 3, y: 3}]]\n      console.dir(index.byY)\n        //=> {}\n    })\n    console.dir(index.byY)\n      //=> {3: [{...}]}\n]\n\n `'^ has no special meaning for dispatching initiated by `#fire() and,\n consequently, in `[=`]wrapped handlers (`#evtpf; compare `'eventIndex\n with `'null to determine the phase).\n\n `'^ separates firing into two groups which are then ordered by priority.\n This means that in response to a `#batch, `[^0^event`] will run before\n `[-1^event`] even though the latter has lower priority.\n[\n    sqim.on('^0^event', () => console.log(0))\n    sqim.on('-1^event', () => console.log(-1))\n\n    sqim.fire('event')      // outputs -1, 0\n\n    sqim.batch(null, function () {\n      this._batch.push(['event'])\n    })    // outputs 0, -1\n]\n\n# Custom events\n You can defer arbitrary events from within `'func by pushing an array to\n `[sqim._batch`], with first member being event name and others being its\n arguments. Because `'sqims is rarely used, `'sqim here is typically\n `'this.\n\n For consistency with Sqimitive's `#ifSet(), provide hooks with\n information (`#_batchOptions()) about the current batch.\n\n[\n  this.batch(function (id) {\n    this._batch.push(['firstOff', 'pa', 'ra', 'ms'])\n    // Or, better:\n    var options = {batch: this._batch, batchID: id, operationID: Core.unique('o')}\n    this._batch.push(['firstOff', 'pa', 'ra', 'ms', options])\n    // Or, best:\n    this._batch.push(['firstOff', 'pa', 'ra', 'ms', this._batchOptions(id)])\n  })\n    // does fire('firstOff', ['pa', 'ra', 'ms'...]) when func returns\n]\n\n Once batched events start firing, the batch is considered \"closed\". This\n typically means that `'_batch will no longer change, allowing heavy\n update functions to process all batched events as one unit in response to\n the first event such a function is interested in, remembering its batch\n ID and ignoring subsequent events with the same ID. Remembering the ID\n might be simpler than maintaining a hash of current state (`'_recalced)\n as in the earlier `'Rect example:\n `[\n  var Rect = new Sqimitive.jQuery.extend({\n    _opt: {width: 0, height: 0},\n    _lastBatch: 0,\n    events: {\n      change_width: '_ifRecalc',\n      change_height: '_ifRecalc',\n    },\n    _ifRecalc: function (now, old, options) {\n      if (this._lastBatch != options.batchID) {\n        this._lastBatch = options.batchID\n        this._recalc()\n      }\n    },\n    _recalc: function () {\n      var w = this.get('width')\n      // ...\n    },\n  })\n `]\n Or the ID itself may be seen as a kind of hash:\n `[\n  var Rect = new Sqimitive.jQuery.extend({\n    _opt: {width: 0, height: 0, _lastBatch: 0},\n    events: {\n      change_width: '_ifRecalc',\n      change_height: '_ifRecalc',\n      change__lastBatch: '_recalc',\n    },\n    _ifRecalc: function (now, old, options) {\n      this.set('_lastBatch', options.batchID)\n    },\n    _recalc: function () { /* as above */ },\n  })\n `]\n\n#skb Skipping known batches\n Things get hairy if your \"`'_ifRecalc\" handler is attached to multiple\n sqimitives and processes all batched sqimitives as one, rather than each\n batched sqimitive's events as one:\n[\n  function update(options) {\n    if (!skip(options)) {    // read below\n      _.each(options.batched, function (item) {\n        // item[0] is a sqimitive.\n        _.each(item[1], function (event) {\n          // Any change must cause an update. Or can check event[1] if\n          // only some _opt'ions cause it. Don't use event[0] == 'change_OPT'\n          // as it will never match since change_OPT is fired prior to\n          // change and is already removed from batched by the time update()\n          // runs.\n          if (event[0] == 'change') {\n            // ...\n    }\n  }\n\n  sqim1.on('change', (name, now, old, options) => update(options))  // (1)\n  sqim2.on('change', (name, now, old, options) => update(options))  // (2)\n  sqim3.on('change', (name, now, old, options) => update(options))  // (3)\n]\n\n Now, `'update() should ignore batches that it has seen. Previously used\n `'!= fails short since there may be events of other sqimitives fired\n between batched events of one sqimitive, as below:\n[\n  var lastBatch = 0\n  function skip(options) {\n    if (lastBatch != options.batchID) {\n      lastBatch = options.batchID\n    } else {\n      return true\n    }\n  }\n\n  sqim3.on('change', function () {    // (4)\n    sqim2.set('quux', 789)\n  })\n  sqim1.batch([sqim3], function () {  // (5)\n    sqim1.set('foo', 123)\n    sqim3.set('bar', 456)\n  })\n    // When batch()'s func returns, first event to be fired happens to be\n    // sqim3 change_bar, handled by (3). skip() receives options.batchID\n    // of N, storing it in lastBatch. Then, change_bar is handled by (4),\n    // which starts another batch (N + 1) that is closed immediately after\n    // set() in (4). This triggers (2), where skip() stores N + 1 in\n    // lastBatch. But now, the pending sqim1 change_foo from (5) triggers\n    // (1) where skip() sees options.batchID of N and considers this batch\n    // to be \"new\", even though it was already processed in response to (3).\n]\n\n Another incorrect solution would be to skip all batches with the same or\n lower ID than previously seen. After all, `'batchID is guaranteed to be\n `#unique and growing. However, the ID is generated when a batch starts\n (before calling `'func), not when the first batched event is dispatched:\n[\n  var lastBatch = 0\n  function skip(options) {\n    if (lastBatch < options.batchID) {\n      lastBatch = options.batchID\n    } else {\n      return true\n    }\n  }\n\n  sqim1.batch(null, function () {\n    sqim1.set('foo', 123)\n    sqim3.set('bar', 456)   // not part of sqim1's batch!\n  })\n    // batch() has allocated the batchID of N before calling func.\n    // Then, before batch()'s func returns, sqim3 change_bar is fired\n    // since this time sqim3 is not part of batch()'s sqims list (the\n    // batchID for change_bar is N + 1). This triggers (3), where\n    // skip() stores N + 1 in lastBatch. Then sqim3.set() returns, then\n    // sqim1.batch()'s func returns and fires the delayed sqim1 change_foo,\n    // to which (1) responds. skip() compares lastBatch of N + 1 with\n    // options.batchID of N and decides this batch is not \"new\".\n]\n\n To summarize, a handler hooked onto multiple objects must store the\n actual list of `'batchID-s it has seen. Most straightforward approach is\n to have a round-robin array holding up to N last IDs but choosing N is\n not trivial - make it too large and you will be wasting memory; make it\n too small and you will be identifying old batches as new.\n\n Instead of hardcoding any such value, we may rely on the fact that a\n given `'batchID can never reappear after the batch ends and that\n `[options.batched`] may not change after the batch has started. We can\n keep only as many IDs in the list as there are currently active batches.\n On the first event, push `'batchID to the list and push an internal event\n to each of the batched sqimitive's current batch. When the event fires N\n times, we pop that `'batchID (N = count of batched sqimitives, except\n ones with empty - already drained - batches).\n[\n  var seenBatches = new Set\n  function skip(options) {\n    if (seenBatches.size == seenBatches.add(options.batchID).size) {\n      // Already saw this batchID.\n      return true\n    } else {\n      // Event is firing in the batch for the first time, across all\n      // batched sqimitives. Wait for all sqimitives to drain this batch.\n      var event = 'mySkip' + Core.unique('mySkip')\n      var remaining = 0\n      _.each(options.batched, function (item) {\n        if (item[1].length) {\n          remaining++\n          item[1].push([event])\n          item[0].once(event, function () {\n            --remaining || seenBatches.delete(options.batchID)\n          })\n        }\n      })\n      // Instead of hooking every batched sqimitive, we could hook only\n      // batched[0] since it will fire its events last. However, the order\n      // in which batched sqimitives are processed is an internal detail.\n    }\n  }\n]\n\n Use `#batchGuard() that implements this algorithm in a generalized form.\n\n# Listening for batch end\n Occasionally you need to do some clean-up when all batched events finish\n but before the next batch starts firing. One way would be to override\n `'batch() itself, tap into `'func and push some internal event into\n `'_batch as the client-provided `'func returns. This is the only option\n when you need to react to every batch, but usually the clean-up is\n necessary only if certain events occurred during a batch, similarly to\n `'try/`'finally (except an exception breaks the batch). In this case you\n can push the internal event to `[options.batch`] or `[options.batched`]\n from within a listener as done in the example in `#skb.\n\n? With the above `'Rect class, we know that `'change_width and\n  `'change_height may trigger a lengthy synchronous process (as a result\n  of the `'_ifRecalc listener) and we want to show hourglass cursor to the\n  user until `'_recalc returns, i.e. the batch ends:\n  `[\n  var rect = new Rect\n  var sym = Symbol()\n  var waiting = 0\n  rect.on('-change_width, -change_height', function (now, old, options) {\n    if (!options.batch[sym]) {\n      $('body').css('cursor', 'wait')\n      options.batch.push(['restoreCursor'])\n      // Fire restoreCursor only once per batch, even if there are other\n      // change events pending.\n      options.batch[sym] = true\n      // This counter is in case we hook several Rect-s or other objects\n      // controlling the cursor.\n      // We could also use the counter alone, ditching Symbol and allowing\n      // duplicate restoreCursor events per batch but that'd be slightly\n      // less efficient.\n      waiting++\n    }\n  })\n  rect.on('restoreCursor', function () {\n    --waiting || $('body').css('cursor', '')\n  })\n  `]\n  In a real application you should make lengthy processes async to avoid\n  freezing the UI. Luckily, `#Async exists just for that.\n\n Generally speaking, it is permitted to modify `[options.batch`] in other\n ways as well, except touching the member corresponding to the event being\n fired. However, this is not recommended as it may quickly become\n unmanageable. In particular, since the order in which listeners are\n called is hard to predict, there is no guarantee that the batch update\n function alike to `'_recalc above will be affected by these modifications\n (such as an added or removed `'change_width) because it might have\n already executed. Or, with the `'skip() function example in `#skb,\n appending a new `#change event that would trigger `'update() will cause\n `'skip() to wrongly report a batch with such event as \"new\" because\n `'skip()'s internal on-batch-end listener has already deleted `'batchID\n from `'seenBatches.\n\n This problem does not exist for internal events like `'restoreCursor and\n `'mySkip that are not used outside of their private scope.","start":{"line":4168,"column":4,"offset":164149},"end":{"line":4256,"column":4,"offset":167294},"forced":null,"modifiers":[],"file":"main.js"},"977":{"type":"class","id":977,"name":"Sqimitive.Base","comment":" Implements what makes Sqimitive `*the`* Sqimitive - options (`#opt),\n children (`#chld) and filtering (`#util) on top of `#Core, which provides\n the fundamental event framework (`#evt).\n\n If you work with DOM then look for `@Sqimitive\\jQuery`@, which adds `#el\n and `#elEvents.

This preserves \"incremental\" update order but also\n  means that `'set() is not always immediately followed by a call to these\n  handlers.\n* Because `#ifSet() creates an implicit `#batch, `#change_OPT and `#change\n  fired for `'OPT receive the same `[options.batchID`] even if you don't\n  wrap the `#ifSet() call into a `#batch().\n##getnset\n* `#get() and `#set() (`#ifSet()) may be seen as public or private API at\n  user's discretion. A complex class may opt for wrappers around these,\n  discouraging its users from direct access to options:\n  `[\n    title: function () { return this.get('title') }\n  `]\n* See also Options overview (`#opt).\n\n##\n\n? Overriding `#ifSet() is possible but most of the time `#normalize_OPT is\n  what you need:\n  `[\n   var MySetter = Sqimitive.Base.extend({\n     _opt: {\n       readOnly: 'foo',\n     },\n\n     events: {\n       // Our handler will be called before the inherited ifSet() and\n       // will prevent modification of this._opt.readOnly when they are\n       // done via set/ifSet (i.e. the recommended way).\n       //\n       // Make sure not to hook '-set' because set() calls ifSet() and it\n       // would be still possible to change 'readOnly' with\n       // ifSet('readOnly', 'bar').\n       '-ifSet': function (opt) {\n         if (opt == 'readOnly') {\n           throw new Error('You shouldn\\'t really change what is called readOnly, you know?')\n         }\n       },\n\n       // normalize_OPT would be better though:\n       normalize_readOnly: function () {\n         throw new Error('You shouldn\\'t change what is called readOnly, you know!')\n       },\n     },\n   })\n  `]\n  Hooking `#ifSet() specifically allows immediate, not `#batch'ed reaction\n  (but consider using `[priority^`] - see `#evtref). `'options will lack\n  some fields at this point though (`#_batchOptions()).\n  `[\n    '-ifSet': function (opt, value, options) {\n      console.log('Option ', opt, ' is about to change to ', value)\n    },\n  `]\n\n#optpropag\n `'options can be used to propagate custom data to the handlers of\n `#normalize_OPT(), `#change_OPT() and `#change(), and even back from them\n (`'options is always an object, possibly empty):\n[\n   Sqimitive.Base.extend({\n     change_foo: function (now, options) {\n       options.foo = 123\n     },\n   })\n\n   var options = {}\n   sqim.set('foo', options)\n   alert(options.foo)       //=> 123\n]","start":{"line":5840,"column":4,"offset":224515},"end":{"line":5875,"column":4,"offset":225953},"forced":null,"modifiers":[],"file":"main.js"},"1006":{"type":"func","id":1006,"name":"isEqual","comment":"#+tag_Utilities\n* `@Base.isEqual()`@\n#\n\n Returns `'true if both arguments are \"same enough\" and `#ifSet() should\n not change `#_opt and fire `#change_OPT.\n\n Default implementation compares arguments using strict equality operator\n (`[===`]).\n\n Remember that in JavaScript, `[NaN !== NaN`] so `[sqim.set('num', NaN)`]\n will fire `#change_OPT even if `'num is already `'NaN.\n\n?

Normally a child is constructed with no `'opt (in `'new/`#init) and gets\n  them via a later `#assignResp(). Use `'newFunc to supply some `'opt'ions\n  early but remember that for existing children (`'eqFunc) only\n  `#assignResp() is called:\n  `[\n  var data = [{foo: 1, bar: 2}, {foo: 3, bar: 4}]\n  assignChildren(data, {\n    newFunc: resp => new ChildClass(_.pick(resp, 'foo', _.forceObject)),\n    // Optionally, if we don't want foo to be considered by assignResp():\n    schema: {foo: false},\n    // Or, if a suitable schema is declared on ChildClass:\n    schema: 'schemaProp',\n  })\n  `]\n\n# The operation\n First, `#assignChildren() determines which `'resp objects are new and\n which are \"serialized\" forms of one of the existing `#_children by\n calling `[options.eqFunc`] with combinations of `[(child, obj)`] for\n every child and data object. `'eqFunc should return `'true exactly for\n none or one such combination. If `[options.eqFunc`] is a string then it's\n assumed that children are identified by an `#_opt'ion by this name (like\n \"id\"), mapping to data objects with the same value of this property:\n[\n   var resp = [ {id: 1, caption: 'foo'}, {id: 2, caption: 'bar'} ]\n   var child = new Sqimitive.Base({id: 1, caption: 'quux'})\n   col.nest(child)\n   col.assignChildren(resp)\n     // col now has 2 children: id=1 'foo', id=2 'bar'\n     // but the first is a new object, not our child object even though\n     // it's the same entity (given the same ID) - we should preserve it\n     // since it may have event listeners set up by other objects\n\n   // But if we'd have done this:\n   col.assignChildren(resp, {eqFunc: 'id'})\n     // col would have 2 children with the same _opt values\n     // but the first would be the same child as nested in the beginning\n     // so its event listeners would be preserved, just 'caption' updated\n\n   // String eqFunc is the same as:\n   col.assignChildren(resp, {eqFunc: function (child, obj) {\n     return child.get('id') == obj.id\n   }})\n]\n\n To recap: children keys (`#_parentKey) are not used when linking\n `#_children and `'resp objects unless you code this in your\n `[options.eqFunc`].\n\n If `[options.eqFunc`] is unset then all existing children are\n `#unlist()'ed unless `[options.keepMissing`] is set - in this case they\n are preserved and for each item in `'resp a new child is nested. However,\n on duplicate keys (`[options.keyFunc`]) only the last child is kept and\n others are removed as per the usual behaviour of `#nest()\n (`#assignChildren() doesn't handle this specially and such\n \"removed-by-nesting\" children are not reflected in the returned array).\n\n Then, for data objects mapped to an existing child `#assignChildren()\n calls `#assignResp() on that child giving it the mapped data object to\n essentially update it. For unmapped, it creates a new Sqimitive by\n `[options.newFunc`], calls `#assignResp() and `#nest-s it under the key\n of `[options.keyFunc`].\n\n Finally, if `[options.keepMissing`] is unset `#assignChildren() removes\n all children which were neither updated not created during this call. If\n it's set then they are just left unchanged as `#_children of `'this.\n\n# Propagation of `'options\n##assignoprop\n ` `#assignChildren() and `#assignResp() call/fire several methods/events\n (`#evt), all of which receive the same `'options object.
